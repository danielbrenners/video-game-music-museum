                  "The NES introduced two more channels of sound than the Commodore 64, but with more restrictions. Instead of being dynamically swappable, the NES placed restrictions on each channel, keeping them playing the same sound constantly. The underlying philosophy was to create a consistent 'band' that composers could use. There were a total of five voices - two square waves for the melodies, one triangle for the bass, one noise for the percussion, and a sparingly used sampler. Although this is the first system to introduce a true sampler (PCM), it was rarely used due to the memory restrictions.",
